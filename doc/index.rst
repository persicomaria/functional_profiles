Welcome to FUNCTIONAL PROFILES documentation!
=============================================

These are github Pages showing how to represent microbial functional annotation pipelines output in form of vectors of K numbers.  The process of annotatin g
genes and or proteins of a microbe assigning their genes protein with a K number or KO enables predicting the metabolic capacity and phenotypic features of organisms.
We refer to this process as ``microbe digitalization`` or ``microbial functions embedding``.
