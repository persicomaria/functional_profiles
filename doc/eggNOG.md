## Overview of eggNOG
The eggNOG (evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups) computational tool, often used via
eggNOG-mapper, is a, high-throughput functional annotation tool that assigns functional descriptions to novel protein sequences (from genomes, transcriptomes, or metagenomes) 
based on orthology rather than simple sequence similarity. 
Its basic principle relies on mapping query sequences to a precomputed database of Orthologous Groups (OGs) spanning all three domains of life, allowing for more precise 
functional transfer compared to traditional BLAST-based approaches.
