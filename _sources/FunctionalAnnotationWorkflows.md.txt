# The most used functional annotation workflows in metagenomics and emerging trends
The most used Functional Annotation Workflows in metagenomics rely on
a combination of fast homology-based searching (using DIAMOND or MMSeqs2) against functional databases like KEGG, eggNOG, and Pfam, 
often structured within automated pipelines. 
These workflows are generally divided into assembly-based approaches (for high-quality, long-read, or deep-sequencing data) and read-based mapping approaches (for rapid profiling)
